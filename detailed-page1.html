            <p class="description">This was an illustrator assignment for the Graphic Design course I went to, where we had to draw an animal<br>
                using a specific method with the shape tools.<br><br>I decided to go with a weasel and was thinking about how I could make it look more interesting and fun,
                turns out weasel do this thing called "The war dance".<br> They will jump around a lot in excitement and are usually very clusmy apperently while doing the dance, hitting and colliding things as they jump.<br><br>
                Sooooo.... Why not make the weasel out of fire jumping around the forest and causing chaos? I thought it'd look pretty cool atleast and it was fun to work on so I'm happy with it!
